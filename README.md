# AI-for-Laughter-Detection-in-Videos
AI tool to detect the areas in videos with the most laughs - it should work on stand-up videos, and on comedy podcast videos.
The result should be a list with the time codes where there were the most laughs.
-------------------
To build an AI tool that detects areas in videos with the most laughs, especially for stand-up and comedy podcasts, we need to follow a multi-step approach that involves audio analysis, speech recognition, and emotion detection. The primary task is to detect laughter events and output the timestamps where they occur.

Here's an approach that leverages Speech-to-Text (for transcription) and Emotion Detection (for identifying laughter):
Steps:

    Extract Audio from Video: First, extract the audio from the video.
    Speech-to-Text (Transcription): Convert the audio to text using a speech recognition system.
    Emotion Detection: Apply emotion detection models on the audio to identify laughter.
    Time Stamps: Capture the timecodes of the laughter events based on detected laughter and generate the list.

For simplicity, we can use existing libraries like:

    SpeechRecognition (for transcription).
    pyAudioAnalysis or pre-trained models (for laughter detection).
    pydub for handling audio extraction and manipulation.

Hereâ€™s an implementation approach using Python:
Prerequisites:

pip install speechrecognition pydub pyAudioAnalysis librosa numpy scipy matplotlib

Python Code:

import speech_recognition as sr
from pydub import AudioSegment
import numpy as np
import librosa
from pyAudioAnalysis import audioFeatureExtraction
from pyAudioAnalysis import audioTrainTest

# Step 1: Extract Audio from Video
def extract_audio_from_video(video_file):
    video = AudioSegment.from_file(video_file)
    audio_file = video_file.replace('.mp4', '.wav')
    video.export(audio_file, format="wav")
    return audio_file

# Step 2: Use Speech Recognition to transcribe speech (not necessary for laughter but useful for context)
def transcribe_audio(audio_file):
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.AudioFile(audio_file) as source:
        audio = recognizer.record(source)
    try:
        text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        return text
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        return "Could not understand audio"
    except sr.RequestError:
        return "Could not request results"

# Step 3: Emotion Detection using audio features (laughter detection)
def detect_laughter(audio_file):
    # Load audio file using librosa
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, sr=None)
    
    # Extract audio features for analysis (MFCC, Zero-Crossing Rate, etc.)
    features = audioFeatureExtraction.stFeatureExtraction(y, sr, 0.050, 0.025)  # window=50ms, step=25ms
    # Calculate energy values to detect laughter events
    energy = features[1, :]
    
    # Define a threshold to detect laughter - adjust as needed
    threshold = np.mean(energy) * 2  # Threshold to detect high energy sections (laughter)
    
    laughter_timestamps = []
    
    # Iterate over the energy signal and detect when the energy is above the threshold
    for i in range(len(energy)):
        if energy[i] > threshold:
            start_time = i * 0.025  # Each frame corresponds to 25 ms
            end_time = (i + 1) * 0.025
            laughter_timestamps.append((start_time, end_time))
    
    return laughter_timestamps

# Step 4: Compile Results and Show Time Codes
def detect_laughter_in_video(video_file):
    # Step 1: Extract Audio
    audio_file = extract_audio_from_video(video_file)
    
    # Step 2: Optionally Transcribe Audio (for contextual analysis, not needed for laughter)
    transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_file)
    print("Transcription (for context):")
    print(transcription)
    
    # Step 3: Detect Laughter
    laughter_timestamps = detect_laughter(audio_file)
    
    # Output: Show laughter timecodes
    print("\nDetected laughter timestamps:")
    for start_time, end_time in laughter_timestamps:
        print(f"Laugh detected from {start_time:.2f} seconds to {end_time:.2f} seconds")
    
    return laughter_timestamps

# Example Usage
video_file = 'standup_comedy_video.mp4'
laughter_timestamps = detect_laughter_in_video(video_file)

# You can use laughter_timestamps to further analyze or visualize the moments in the video

Code Explanation:

    Extract Audio from Video:
        pydub is used to extract audio from video files. In this case, the video is converted to a .wav file, which is easier to analyze.

    Speech Recognition:
        The SpeechRecognition library is used to convert the audio to text using Google's Speech API. This step is optional but useful for providing context to the video or if you want to analyze dialogue alongside laughter detection.

    Emotion Detection (Laughter Detection):
        The pyAudioAnalysis library is used to extract features like energy from the audio signal. These energy values are used to detect when there is a burst of activity in the audio, which often corresponds to laughter.
        A threshold is applied to the energy values to detect peaks that likely represent laughter.

    Time Codes:
        The detected laughter events are returned as timestamps, indicating the start and end times for each detected laugh. These timecodes can be used to locate the laughter moments in the video.

    Example Usage:
        The detect_laughter_in_video function integrates all the steps. You provide a video file, and it outputs a list of timestamps where laughter is detected.

Additional Improvements:

    Laughter Classification: To improve accuracy, you can train a model specifically for detecting laughter using machine learning or deep learning models.
    Audio Segmentation: For complex cases, the detection of specific laughter types (e.g., chuckles vs. loud laughs) could be improved with better segmentation techniques or specialized emotion detection models.
    Integration with Video: You can integrate these timestamps with the video directly to highlight or jump to moments of laughter.

Note:

    This solution assumes the audio is clear and without heavy background noise.
    You can fine-tune the threshold for energy-based laughter detection or implement more sophisticated methods such as using pre-trained emotion detection models.

This AI-based tool can effectively help identify and highlight the moments of laughter in stand-up comedy or podcasts, providing insightful analysis for comedy creators or researchers.
